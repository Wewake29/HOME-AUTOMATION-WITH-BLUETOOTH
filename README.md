# HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-BLUETOOTH

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: VIVEK VILAS KAMBLE

*INTERN ID*: CT04DZ256 

*DOMAIN*: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: 

*Importance of the Project*

This project enables real-time temperature monitoring and display through a smartphone using a temperature sensor connected to a microcontroller. Unlike a simple LCD display, this system allows wireless data transmission (via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) to an Android device, giving users the ability to monitor temperature remotely.
It is important because:

It teaches sensor interfacing and wireless communication with Arduino.

It shows how to integrate hardware with a custom mobile app.

It can be applied to IoT-based monitoring systems.

It provides a low-cost solution for personal or industrial temperature monitoring.

*Components Used*

The typical hardware setup includes:

1. Arduino Uno / Nano / ESP32 – main controller.

2. Temperature Sensor – LM35 (analog) or DS18B20 (digital).

3. Bluetooth Module HC-05 – for wireless communication with mobile (or ESP32 for built-in Wi-Fi).

4. Android Smartphone – to display readings via the MIT App.

5. Jumper Wires – for connections.

6. Breadboard – for circuit prototyping.

7. Power Supply – USB or adapter.

*Software Used*

1. Arduino IDE – for writing and uploading code to the Arduino board.

2. MIT App Inventor – to design and develop the mobile application without complex coding.

3. Bluetooth Terminal / Serial Communication Libraries – to handle wireless data transfer between Arduino and the app.

4. (Optional) Tinkercad Circuits – to simulate the hardware before actual building.

*Applications*

Home Temperature Monitoring – track indoor temperatures and get alerts if limits are exceeded.

Greenhouses & Agriculture – maintain optimal plant growth conditions.

Food Storage – monitor cold storage or refrigeration units.

Industrial Monitoring – check temperature-sensitive processes.

IoT Projects – integrate with cloud databases for remote access.

Educational Use – learn sensor interfacing, mobile app development, and wireless communication.
